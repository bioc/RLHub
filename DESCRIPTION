Description: |
    RLHub provides a convenient interface to the processed data provided within
    RLSuite, a tool-chain for analyzing R-loop-mapping data sets. 
    The primary purpose of RLHub is to serve the processed data sets 
    required by the RLSeq R package and the RLBase web service. Additionally, 
    RLHub provides a stand-alone R interface to these data, benefiting 
    users who are addressing questions related to R-loop regions (RL-Regions), 
    R-loop-binding proteins (RLBPs), R-loop co-localizing factors, 
    and the differences between R-loop-mapping methods. 
    The full data-generating protocol is found here:
